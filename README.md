# Lantern Dragon Works
--------------------

Welcome.

Lantern Dragon Works is a small collection of fictional novels inspired by Japanese visual novels and themes.

All credit for creation, story-writing, and characters go to the sole author, DeltaOG (long may he live).

For now, this website is still in its infancy, as are my development. Therefore, if you
would like a more complete experience, on a more worthy interface, please visit our WordPress Page*.
Though be sure to come back and visit again when this project becomes awesome.

Regards, and enjoy your stay,

A lowly member of the Lantern Dragons Works team.
