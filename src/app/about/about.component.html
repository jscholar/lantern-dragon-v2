      Welcome.

      Lantern Dragon Works is a small collection fictional of novels inspired by Japanese visual novels and themes.

      All credit for creation, storywriting, and characters go to the sole author, Jie Long Chen (long may he live).

      For now, this website is still in its infancy, as are my development skills. Therefore, if you
      would like a more complete experience, on a more worthy interface, please our <a href="https://lanterndragonworks.wordpress.com/">WordPress page</a>.
      Though be sure to come back and visit when this project becomes awesome.

      Regards, and enjoy your stay,

      A lowly member of the Lantern Dragons Works team.
